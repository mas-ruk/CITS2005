Key Learnings from this Lab:

Ex. 2: Addition.java
- You can add char and int variables together 
- i.e. when i add the integer 1 & the char '1' together it returns 50, as the ASCII value of 1 is 49
- adding an integer and a floating point number together converts the result to a floating point number
- cannot add int and bool together
- adding a String and int together converts the int to a String variable and concatenates them

Q1: Look at Java operations precedence table

Q2: What happens when operators with the same precedence appear in an expression? What order are the executed in? 
Do brackets change the order or execution?

- When operators of equal precedence appear in the same expression, a rule must govern which is evaluated first. 
- All binary operators except for the assignment operators are evaluated from left to right; assignment operators are evaluated right to left.

Q3: Does Java follow BODMAS?
- Generally, yes. Multiplication, division and remainder are applied first. 
- If an expression contains several such operations, they are evaluated left to right.
- Addition and subtraction operations are applied next, again if they contain multiple of the same precedence they are applied left to right.

Q4: (to do with the FourToEight class file) Change the class to print "yes" if num is between 4 and 8 and "no" otherwise. 
You should use the following operators: <=, >=, and &&

Q5: How does && having lower precedence than <= and >= help?
- evaluates both seperate expressions before comparing them

Q6: Consider the Boolean class. Is there an assignment of a, b, and c that causes "a || b && c" to be true but not "(a || b) && c"?
- When c is false, this case becomes reality
- The initial statement will always evaluate to true when the value of a is true
- The latter statement requires both statements (a || b) to be true as well as can
- when c is false, the latter statement will always be false
